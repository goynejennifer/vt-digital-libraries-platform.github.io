The Digital Libraries Team has achieved multi-site status!  Our current sprint delivers a Minimum Viable Product for Southwest Virginia Archive and begins work on a VT Publishing Podcast Library.  The SWVA site will replace the existing [Omeka site](http://di.lib.vt.edu/ "Omeka site"), which is our second legacy system retirement!  Here's to reducing maintanence obligations.

Key features of the Podcast Library include:
- Access to and preservation of the transcripts, files, and metadata
- RSS aggerator support
- Audio streaming and direct download
- View and download analytics
- User submission interface
- Support for user-provided transcripts

This is pretty exciting for us since it's the first non-static image collection we're implementing in the DLP.  It also provides functionality that we can use to support oral history collections, of which the Libraries has many.

In a future iteration, we'd like to add time-range URI linking and automated transcription generation when one is not provided.

We're also working on a new template painstakingly arrived at in close cooperation between our Web Development Librarian, Web Designer, and stakeholders.  April's going to be a big month for the team!
